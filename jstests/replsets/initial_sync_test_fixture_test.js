/*
 * Test to check that the Initial Sync Test Fixture properly pauses initial sync.
 *
 * The test checks that both the collection cloning and oplog application stages of initial sync
 * pause after exactly one commad is run when the test fixture's step function is called. The test
 * issues the same listDatabases and listCollections commands that collection cloning does so we
 * know all the commands that will be run on the sync source and can verify that only one is run per
 * call to step(). Similarly for oplog application, we can check the log messages to make sure that
 * the batches being applied are of the expected size and that only one batch was applied per step()
 * call.
